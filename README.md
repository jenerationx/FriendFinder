# FriendFinder

In this project, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I made mine princess-themed so you can find out which Disney Princess would be your BFF!
